### Goals
The color flipper page will:
- have a button to randomize a new color
  - phase 1: from an array
  - phase 2: from randomized hex value
- the new random color will 
  - display its identifier in text
  - update the background color

## Considerations
- contrast behind text for reading behind any color
- button color contrast to easily find button
  - can we calculate polar opposite color value?
- nav bar to switch between chosing color from list vs completely random
  - possible to transition smoothly (e.g. don't reset the color when navigating between tabs)
    - how to store current color? pass via page parameter? store value in localStorage?

## Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Finally looked up how to use the favicons!

```
<head>
  <link rel="icon" href="favicon.png" type="image/png">
</head>
```

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
